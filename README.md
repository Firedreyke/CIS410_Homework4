The various charts at the end of the "HW4_Exams.ipynb" file show the following:

* There is minimal to no significant difference between the average scores in math, reading and writing for the male and female groups.
	* The barchart grouped by gender and the means of each score show that there is very little difference in average score between the male and female students, although it is worth mentioning that female students typically scored lower in reading than the male students, but performed better in reading and writing.

* A large amount of students' parents, as part of the study, attended high school and at least some college (associate's degree or lower), but very few graduated with a bachelor's or master's degree.

* Students that completed the test preparation course always recieved better scores than 30 in both reading and writing, with most falling between 60 and 100 in both subjects; those who did not had some propensity for weaker scores, but there is still significant overlap.
	* The scatter plot shows students that did not complete the course in blue, and those that did in orange. There are several points on the scatter plot that are blue and fall below 40 in both categories, while all in orange are higher than that. Most of the blue points, however, DO fall in a similar range to the yellow, except for the lower stragglers. More data would likely be needed to draw a complete conclusion as to whether the test preparation course holds significant sway over grading, but this at least indicates the possibility.
